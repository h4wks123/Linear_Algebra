In this equation, the term $x^{-1}$ represents the reciprocal of x, which violates the condition of having only variables raised to the first power. Moreover, the presence of $\\sin{(\\frac{\\pi}{2})}$ introduces nonlinearity as it is a trigonometric function.<br><br>\n",

The variables are raised only to the first power, which automatically satisfies this condition. Moreover, the variables are combined together with a coefficient of 1. In addition, the right side of the linear equation is a constant value being represented as 0.<br>"

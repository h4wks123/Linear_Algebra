A linear equation has the prerequisites of not multiplying or dividing variables with each other and the term $\\cos{\\theta}x$ includes the product of both the $\\cos{\\theta}$ and x making it nonlinear.<br><br>\n",

    "- $cos{x}4y+z = \\sqrt{3}$\n",
    "    - The equation shown above is a nonlinear equation because there are two issues that violates the criteria of linear equations which includes the presence of $\\cos{x}$ as the variable must appear to the first power. Moreover, the multiplication of variables being represented in 4y also violates the criteria of linear equations.<br><br>\n",

    "- $x^{-1}+7y+z = \\sin{(\\frac{\\pi}{2})}$\n",
    "    - The equation being represented above is a nonlinear equation as it violates the criteria of linear equations. In this equation, the term $x^{-1}$ represents the reciprocal of x, which violates the condition of having only variables raised to the first power. Moreover, the presence of $\\sin{(\\frac{\\pi}{2})}$ introduces nonlinearity as it is a trigonometric function.<br><br>\n",
    "- $x^1+y^1+z^1=0$\n",
    "    - The equation shown above meets the criteria of a linear equation as it is characterized with the necessary prerequisites. The variables are raised only to the first power, which automatically satisfies this condition. Moreover, the variables are combined together with a coefficient of 1. In addition, the right side of the linear equation is a constant value being represented as 0.<br>"
